## Overview  
I recently ventured into the field of data analytics, and to be honest, I had no clear understanding of what a data analyst does, what skills are required, or how different analyst roles compare. However, thanks to **Luke Barousse’s Python Course**, I was able to conduct a thorough analysis of the **Vietnamese job market** and gain valuable insights.  

## Key aspects of the **data analytics job market in Vietnam**, including:
